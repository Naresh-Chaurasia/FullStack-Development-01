*What is #Angular#*

Angular is a combination of prewritten code, useful tools, and some structured guidelines, all packaged together with a clear purpose, help you build web applications of any size. This combination is called a web framework, and Angular is one of the most popular

Angular's use of a *component‑based architecture*, mainly helping to break down large projects into smaller parts.

Components are self‑contained chunks of functionality managing how something shows up for the user and all of the logic for that piece of your application.

What is *#e-commerce application#* and what are some of its functionalities

An e-commerce application is a digital platform that facilitates buying and selling goods or services over the internet. These applications provide users with a virtual marketplace where they can browse, select, and purchase products or services without the need for physical interaction. Here are some common functionalities of e-commerce applications:

1. **Product Catalog**: An organized listing of products or services available for purchase, typically categorized and searchable to facilitate easy browsing.

2. **User Accounts**: User registration and authentication systems that allow customers to create accounts, manage their profiles, view order history, and track shipments.

3. **Shopping Cart**: A virtual shopping cart that enables users to add, remove, and manage selected items before proceeding to checkout.

4. **Checkout Process**: A streamlined process for users to complete their purchases, including options for payment methods, shipping addresses, and order review.

5. **Payment Gateway Integration**: Integration with secure payment gateways to facilitate various payment methods such as credit/debit cards, digital wallets, bank transfers, and more.

6. **Order Management**: Backend functionality for administrators to manage orders, process payments, update order status, and handle returns or refunds.

7. **Inventory Management**: Tools for managing product inventory, including tracking stock levels, restocking products, and managing product variations (e.g., sizes, colors).

8. **Security Features**: Implementation of security measures such as SSL encryption, PCI compliance, and protection against fraud to ensure safe transactions and safeguard customer data.

9. **Responsive Design**: Compatibility with various devices and screen sizes to ensure a seamless shopping experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

10. **Search and Filters**: Advanced search capabilities and filtering options to help users quickly find specific products based on criteria such as price, brand, category, or popularity.

11. **Product Reviews and Ratings**: Features that allow customers to leave reviews and ratings for products, helping other users make informed purchasing decisions.

12. **Personalization**: Customization features that provide personalized recommendations, promotions, and content based on user preferences and browsing history.

13. **Social Media Integration**: Integration with social media platforms to enable sharing of products, user-generated content, and customer feedback, as well as social login options.

14. **Analytics and Reporting**: Tools for tracking key metrics such as sales performance, customer behavior, conversion rates, and website traffic to inform business decisions and optimize strategies.

15. **Customer Support**: Channels for providing customer support, including live chat, email support, FAQs, and help centers to assist users with inquiries, issues, or technical support.

*Angular is #Interpreted/Compiled#*

Angular applications are written using TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript. TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript before it's executed by the browser. This compilation process happens before the code is deployed to a web server or served to clients.

Once the Angular application is deployed to a server and accessed by a user's browser, the JavaScript code generated by the TypeScript compiler is interpreted and executed by the browser. The browser parses the JavaScript code and renders the corresponding HTML and CSS to create the interactive web application that users can see and interact with.

In summary, Angular code is written in TypeScript, compiled into JavaScript, and then interpreted by the user's browser to render the web application.

*What is #Routing# in modern web frameworks*

In an old traditional website, when you clicked on a link, it would go back to the server and load a completely new web page into the browser. However, that's a problem in modern web applications because as soon as you load a new web page from the server, you'd lose all of your browser state like the items in your cart, for example. And so in a modern web application, when you click a link, typically that doesn't require any conversation at all with the server. Instead, the website uses JavaScript to simply swap out portions of the HTML with other HTML it already has stored in memory without actually changing pages as far as the browser knows. This allows us to maintain state, and swapping pages like this is called *routing in modern web frameworks*

*What is #TypeScript#*

You might hear Angular referred to as a JavaScript framework, but Angular apps are created using TypeScript, a programming language that's built on top of JavaScript. People often refer to TypeScript as a superset of JavaScript, but you really don't need to know all the details around that. *Just know that code written in TypeScript when compiled becomes JavaScript, enabling it to run in the browser*. You can think of TypeScript as a language that fixes a lot of the issues that tend to come along with using JavaScript, and it gives us cleaner code and less errors at the same time
